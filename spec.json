This is an evaluable expression that will group the counts and specify the group in the `group` attribute in the output signal.\nPersistence is used to maintain the cumulative count between stopping and starting the block.\nThe cumulative count can be reset by using the *reset* command or by using one of the `reset_info` options. The `reset_info` properties allow for configuration of the block to reset the cumulative count based on a recurring `INTERVAL` or a specific time by using the `CRON` setting. On reset, a signal is notified. It contains the *cumulative_count* right before the reset and the *count* is zero.",
